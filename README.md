If you want to download all the source-code, you should have Maven and JDK installed.
Download the Git-repo and type in the terminal:
mvn clean package
Then to run the created JAR-file:
java -jar ./target/theWebsite-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

If you do not have Maven installed, or you just want to run the program without all the source-code,
you can download the JAR-file from this link:

NOTICE: You still need to have JDK to run the JAR-file.
